            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sir <hi>Theophilus Jones,</hi> and Collonell <hi>Chidley Cootes</hi> Regiments of Horſe, with Collonell <hi>Venables</hi> his Troope, and <hi>Liſnegarvy</hi>

Horſe, Colonell <hi>Slaydes</hi> Regiment of Foot, part of Colonell <hi>Venables,</hi> and foure Companies of Colonel <hi>Fenwicks,</hi> in all about 1500 Foot, and 1200 Horſe. The next day we advanced to <hi>Liſnegarvy,</hi> and lay there ſix dayes, though very ill accommodated by reaſon of the former burning of that place and Country about it by <hi>Monro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On Friday, the 30 of <hi>November,</hi> the Enemy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into the Country, and ſlipt by us beyond <hi>Drummore</hi> into <hi>Mac Cartans</hi> woods, which we could not hinder, lying at ſuch a diſtance; nor could we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance higher into the Country, without hazzarding the Enemies paſſage another way over Bogs and Mountaines to <hi>Carrickfergus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On Saturday, they came to <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and early on Sunday, to New Towne. We followed them, and had like to have ingaged them on their riſing from <hi>Cumber,</hi> ſome of them were cut off in the Rear, and ſome of their Tents and Ammunition taken, but comming a little ſhort, and the waters being up, they got into New Towne, whither we ſent a ſtrong par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to face them, and provoke them to fight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto not finding them inclined, and the weather ſo exceſſive wet, our Ammunition ſpoyled, and victuals ſpent, we marched backe to <hi>Malone</hi> to refreſh our men, change our Powder, and get new ſupply of Bread, intending to viſit them againe within two dayes. But they prevented it by their march upon Wedneſday laſt the 5 Inſtant within a Mile of <hi>Liſne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garvy,</hi> intending to get over the River of <hi>Laggan</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that place, and to paſſe into the County of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim</hi> to <hi>Carrikfergus,</hi> on which we drew up againe to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97686:3"/>
                  <hi>Lyſnegarvy,</hi> on this ſide of the water to oppoſe their paſſage, expecting hourely, with Major <hi>Ormesby</hi> 400 more of my Horſe, which I had ſent for out of the <hi>Laggan,</hi> who came immediately after our advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and were very ſerviceable in the execution. The next morning aſſoon as the Enemy aroſe, we march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after them very early out of <hi>Liſnegarvy,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had marched a mile from their Quarter, we ingaged with their Rear-guard upon a Boggy paſſe on the Plaine of <hi>Lyſneſreane,</hi> and after an hot diſpute, our Van-guard of Foot, being commanded by Major <hi>Gore</hi> of my owne Regiment, and that of Horſe by Major <hi>Dunbar</hi> of Sir <hi>Theophilus Jones</hi> his Regiment, who both behaved themſelves very gallantly, got the Paſſe, and killed Cap. <hi>Hambleton,</hi> and divers others in the charge.</p>
               <p>After which Forlorne of Horſe, it was Sir <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus Jones</hi> place to charge; who did it with a great deale of gallantry proſecuting the Enemy (whoſe groſſe Body made little reſiſtance) from place to place, till they were totally routed.</p>
               <p>I ſent off Major <hi>King,</hi> and Cap. St. <hi>George,</hi> with a party of Horſe, to make good a Paſſe, which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of neceſſity muſt have gone through, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves extream well in proſecution of the Orders given them; ſo that we conceive there could not be leſſe killed then a thouſand of the Enemy; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officer or Souldier of the Army omitting any thing that was poſſible to be done by men; the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being purſued above eight or ten miles, and but for the Bogs and thicke wood, few of them could have eſcaped. And ſuch horſemen as did eſcape, left
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97686:4"/>
many of their horſes, and fled on foot.</p>
               <p>All their Ammunition and Baggage was taken, and moſt of their foot Officers. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Henderſon</hi> that betrayed <hi>Sligo,</hi> was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and Col. <hi>Hambleton</hi> is priſoner, with divers other Officers; what became of the Lords of <hi>Ards,</hi> and <hi>Claneboyes,</hi> and <hi>Monro,</hi> I am not yet able to give an account, ſome of our party being yet upon the purſuite; their number was 2000 Foot, and 800 Horſe, as we were informed, the night before we inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with them, by ſome of their men that ran to us from them, as likewiſe by priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which we took in the fight; they were all Iriſh except a very few.</p>
               <p>The moſt of the Scots which the Lords brought with them, left them, nor did any in the Country joyne with them; wee loſt but one corporall of Horſe, and three pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Souldiers, and not many hurt. For all which wee have great cauſe to bleſſe Gods holy name, to whom only the glory is due.</p>
               <p>On Thurſday next <hi>Carickfergus</hi> by the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation is to be ſurrendred unto us; and I doubt not they will now performe with us;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97686:4"/>
but ſuch is the ſad condition of this Province by theſe late troubles, and the great deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that hath been made by all parties that it is impoſſible to ſupport men enough out of the contributions thereof, to ſecure the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons and Country, from the incurſions of the Enemy, untill <hi>Charlemount,</hi> and <hi>Eniskelly</hi> be firſt taken in; ſo that the Parliament muſt be pleaſed to afford us ſupplies for our men; or this Country, now almoſt waſted, will be totally ruined; which but moderately hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for one ſix months, would afford a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant conſiderable reliefe to their Forces.</p>
